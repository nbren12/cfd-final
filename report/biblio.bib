@article{Shu2009,
	Abstract = {High order accurate weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) schemes are relatively new but have gained rapid popularity in numerical solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and other convection dominated problems. The main advantage of such schemes is their capability to achieve arbitrarily high order formal accuracy in smooth regions while maintaining stable, nonoscillatory, and sharp discontinuity transitions. The schemes are thus especially suitable for problems containing both strong discontinuities and complex smooth solution features. WENO schemes are robust and do not require the user to tune parameters. At the heart of the WENO schemes is actually an approximation procedure not directly related to PDEs, hence the WENO procedure can also be used in many non-PDE applications. In this paper we review the history and basic formulation of WENO schemes, outline the main ideas in using WENO schemes to solve various hyperbolic PDEs and other convection dominated problems, and pres...},
